Over 75% of people are chronically low in electrolytes
Hydration isn’t just about water. You need sodium, magnesium, and potassium to actually feel energized.

Most people don’t need more caffeine—they need more salt.

I take electrolytes daily to fight fatigue, support my workouts, reduce cravings, and actually stay hydrated (because water alone doesn’t cut it 💧).

If you’re working out, eating clean, intermittent fasting, or just tired all the time… this might be the missing piece.
I use LMNT because it’s clean, zero sugar, and actually tastes GOOD.

Comment “link” if you want $50 off my round starting tmw! 

But before you can achieve it, you have to promise yourself you’ll stay consistent. 

The promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep and easiest to break. 

The reason you lack confidence is because you lack self belief. And the reason you lack self belief is because you dont keep the promises you make to yourself. 

Ive told myself for years i would keep weight off once and for all- yet i always found a reason to stop because no one was looking. 

18 months ago  I finally stuck with it - not because i want to share it here, but because i promised myself i would do it- and im keeping that promise. And now im down almost 17 lbs 

When you make promises to yourself and you dont keep them, you reinforce the thought pattern that you are someone who doesnt follow thru-

Just starting with the little shit- making my bed, going to the gym, saving the money- follow thru on what you said you will do and it’ll bleed into every other capacity of your life

But before you can achieve it, you have to promise yourself you’ll stay consistent. 

The promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep and easiest to break. 

The reason you lack confidence is because you lack self belief. And the reason you lack self belief is because you dont keep the promises you make to yourself. 

Ive told myself for years i would keep weight off once and for all- yet i always found a reason to stop because no one was looking. 

12 months ago  I finally stuck with it - not because i want to share it here, but because i promised myself i would do it- and im keeping that promise. And now im down almost 20 lbs 

When you make promises to yourself and you dont keep them, you reinforce the thought pattern that you are someone who doesnt follow thru-

Just starting with the little shit- making my bed, going to the gym, saving the money- follow thru on what you said you will do and it’ll bleed into every other capacity of your life

I see women carry 10 full grocery bags so they don’t have to make 2 trips, but are scared of getting “bulky” if they lift more than 3 lbs. 🫠

Is it a great place to start if you’re just getting started on weight lifting, working on form, coming back from an injury, etc. absolutely! But if you’ve been staying at the same weight for YEARS, and wondering why you aren’t getting toned-it’s one of 2 things. Your nutrition and/or you not lifting heavy. 

Comment “link” if you want what I did! 

You don’t need to be a meat head, but you need to challenge yourself. I went from body weight, to 15 reps, to 8-10 reps max over the past year to build lean muscle mass and than put myself in a caloric deficit to shed thr fat off that muscle!! I also supplement to build and recovery my muscles fast!

This isn’t about restriction—it’s about routines that work long-term.
These were the game-changers:
→ Lifting 3x a week (upper/lower/full body)
→ High protein + macro tracking (30–50g per meal)
→ Walking + cardio (yes, even SkiErg 🫠)
→ Supplements that supported my recovery & energy
→ Electrolytes to fight fatigue, bloat & headaches
→ Shoes & outfits that made me feel GOOD

But before you can achieve it, you have to promise yourself you’ll stay consistent. 

If you want of join my program starting monday on how I did it-comment “link” here AND I have a $50 off code!!!! For this round ONLY

The promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep and easiest to break. 

The reason you lack confidence is because you lack self belief. And the reason you lack self belief is because you dont keep the promises you make to yourself. 

Ive told myself for years i would keep weight off once and for all- yet i always found a reason to stop because no one was looking. 

A year ago I finally stuck with it - not because i want to share it here, but because i promised myself i would do it- and im keeping that promise. And now im down 17 lbs in a year (gained a lot in 2024) 

When you make promises to yourself and you dont keep them, you reinforce the thought pattern that you are someone who doesnt follow thru-

Just starting with the little shit- making my bed, going to the gym, saving the money- follow thru on what you said you will do and it’ll bleed into every other capacity of your life
