Some of the most successful women I know and love possess these qualities and it’s a reminder that being different, bigger, better and becoming the best version of yourself often means you’ll be misunderstood and unsupported.

Comment START  if you want to join my 21 day reset starting Monday!! 

before you can achieve it, you have to promise yourself you’ll stay consistent. 

The promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep and easiest to break. 

The reason you lack confidence is because you lack self belief. And the reason you lack self belief is because you dont keep the promises you make to yourself. 

Ive told myself for years i would keep weight off once and for all- yet i always found a reason to stop because no one was looking. 

18 months ago  I finally stuck with it - not because i want to share it here, but because i promised myself i would do it- and im keeping that promise. And now im down almost 17 lbs 

When you make promises to yourself and you dont keep them, you reinforce the thought pattern that you are someone who doesnt follow thru-

Just starting with the little shit- making my bed, going to the gym, saving the money- follow thru on what you said you will do and it’ll bleed into every other capacity of your life

One thing I’ve learned this year is
there’s a subtle but important difference between kindness and our modern idea of “niceness.” 

Niceness often means being agreeable, soft, or avoiding conflict. But in Scripture, God’s kindness is rooted in truth, discipline, and love—which sometimes comes through correction, judgment, or refinement.
 Be bold. Be a good person but remember that doesn’t always mean (and most often) nice",7,"09/24/2025 10:03",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO_iCOfjR9n/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,467193,295215,31791,6093,200,166,2442

But before you can achieve it, you have to promise yourself you’ll stay consistent. 

The promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep and easiest to break. 

The reason you lack confidence is because you lack self belief. And the reason you lack self belief is because you dont keep the promises you make to yourself. 

Ive told myself for years i would keep weight off once and for all- yet i always found a reason to stop because no one was looking. 

18 months ago  I finally stuck with it - not because i want to share it here, but because i promised myself i would do it- and im keeping that promise. And now im down almost 17 lbs 

When you make promises to yourself and you dont keep them, you reinforce the thought pattern that you are someone who doesnt follow thru-

Just starting with the little shit- making my bed, going to the gym, saving the money- follow thru on what you said you will do and it’ll bleed into every other capacity of your life

Weight loss truths im going to tell you because i dont care if i hurt your feelings- from someone who’s lost almost 20 lbs 

Worry more about whats on your fork vs what workout class youre doing- 90% of fat loss comes from your nutrition 

If youre trying to lose weight or get healthy- you have to go thru the phase where you’re doing everything right and it sucks and you’re not seeing any results- thats apart of the process 

If you give up every time you look a little stupid or you feel like the plan isn’t working you are never going to get anywhere- if youre sick of starting over, stop stopping

body positivity means loving your body enough to take care of it

It doesnt matter if you have a nutritionist, personal trainer, or signed up for the plan- We all have access to the same info-  if youre not going to do the work despite having all the right people in place you wont see results 

All diets work as long as youre in a calorie deficit- calories are king, protein is queen 

Walking is underrated

Youre like unaware of your portion size- you could be eating the right things but not realize how quickly things add up- creamers in coffee, oils in pans, the dressings that you use, the weekends out

Clean eating doesnt equal fat loss- you can cut out all processed food and still gain weight- just because you went from cookie dough ice cream to chick pea cookie dough might still be the same amount of calories youre consuming 

Youre never too far gone  ever. Youcan always turn it around, you can always have your dream body, always",59,"09/17/2025 08:57",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOtYzpKDEWM/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,37225,25416,863,22,7,116,47

I shared on stories this week that a spiritual shift within me has happened. 

My parents divorced when I was 10 and i didn’t have a lot of religious guidance and spent a lot of my life in and out of faith. 

There was a time recently in my adult life when I had a very hardened and hateful heart.  I was at a crossroads in my faith. I was, bitter, fearful, and was a super angry person. Something stirred within me and at that same time I was asked to join a Bible study group. And God has quite literally healed my heart since then. I’m learning how to try and see Jesus the way he does, despite our difference. I will stand for what is right against evil and I will never apologize for my faith.",5,"09/14/2025 16:30",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOmeRuSDZMh/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,50625,26043,2171,24,14,155,52

- If you’re not consistent, your program doesn’t matter. The best results come from the “average” plan done consistently, not the perfect one done rarely
- 
- ��Your biggest results won’t come from doing more they’ll come from doing the boring basics better
- 
- �You can’t “spot reduce” fat. No amount of P90x and will reduce belly fat. Fat loss happens systemically, not locally
- 
- �You’re not “toning”. you’re either building muscle or losing fat. “Toning” is just the visual result of reducing the body fat on that muscle 
- 
- 
- �Your body doesn’t reflect your dreams, it reflects your discipline. If you lack intention, your results will reflect that

Your lack of patience, time management and excuses are the problem-not your genetics. You didn’t lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks, you’re not going to lose it in 6 weeks 

Exercise doesn’t just improve your physical body. It’ll motivate you to become a better version of yourself 
Losing weight isn’t the best thing about me, but it WAS the foundation to every positive change in my life this year. 

Your food may be “boring” or if you’ve been following my stories “miserable” 😂
Once you stop fueling your body with processed shit you’ll realize so much of the results come during the “ boring “ 
Fueling my body with real food and loving how I look and feel will never be miserable. 

It’s ok if you want to lose weight. In a society where that’s been deemed “toxic” 
I actually think me living in a body I wasn’t confident in and didn’t take care of was much more toxic. No one should make you feel like shit for wanting to improve yourself.",58,"09/06/2025 13:02",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DORgJbSErhu/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,75927,48409,1720,50,20,342,141

Day 4 is all about decluttering: your closet, mindset and circle! 

-starting with the obvious- our closet 

	•	Less clutter 
	•	Every piece has a purpose → saves time & stress in the mornings
	•	Creates space for styles that actually feel like you right now
	•	Easier to see what you own → cuts down on wasteful spending

⸻

Mindset
	•	Decluttering your space declutters your head
	•	A simplified environment = more focus and creativity
	•	Less “stuff” means less mental load → more energy for what matters
	•	Letting go of old items symbolizes letting go of old versions of yourself

People in Our Lives- negative people who used to take up space so longer are going to consume us 

	•	Not everyone belongs in every season of your life
	•	Surrounding yourself with supportive people helps you grow
	•	Letting go of draining relationships = more room for uplifting ones
	•	Just like a closet refresh, your circle should reflect who you are becoming",41,"09/03/2025 18:02",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOKT_WOjVsg/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,32684,23449,1202,11,7,899,21

Comment “start ” if you want to join my round starting tmw! 

But before you can achieve it, you have to promise yourself you’ll stay consistent. 

The promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep and easiest to break. 

The reason you lack confidence is because you lack self belief. And the reason you lack self belief is because you dont keep the promises you make to yourself. 

Ive told myself for years i would keep weight off once and for all- yet i always found a reason to stop because no one was looking. 

18 months ago  I finally stuck with it - not because i want to share it here, but because i promised myself i would do it- and im keeping that promise. And now im down almost 17 lbs 

When you make promises to yourself and you dont keep them, you reinforce the thought pattern that you are someone who doesnt follow thru-

Just starting with the little shit- making my bed, going to the gym, saving the money- follow thru on what you said you will do and it’ll bleed into every other capacity of your life

This isn’t about restriction—it’s about routines that work long-term.
These were the game-changers:
→ Lifting 3x a week (upper/lower/full body)
→ High protein + macro tracking (30–50g per meal)
→ Walking + cardio (yes, even SkiErg 🫠)
→ Supplements that supported my recovery & energy
→ Electrolytes to fight fatigue, bloat & headaches

Big sister facts I wish someone would’ve told me!

- If you’re not consistent, your program doesn’t matter. The best results come from the “average” plan done consistently, not the perfect one done rarely
- 
- ��Your biggest results won’t come from doing more they’ll come from doing the boring basics better
- 
- �You can’t “spot reduce” fat. No amount of P90x and will reduce belly fat. Fat loss happens systemically, not locally
- 
- �You’re not “toning”. you’re either building muscle or losing fat. “Toning” is just the visual result of reducing the body fat on that muscle 
- 
- 
- �Your body doesn’t reflect your dreams, it reflects your discipline. If you lack intention, your results will reflect that

Your lack of patience, time management and excuses are the problem-not your genetics. You didn’t lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks, you’re not going to lose it in 6 weeks 

Exercise doesn’t just improve your physical body. It’ll motivate you to become a better version of yourself 
Losing weight isn’t the best thing about me, but it WAS the foundation to every positive change in my life this year. 

Your food may be “boring” or if you’ve been following my stories “miserable” 😂
Once you stop fueling your body with processed shit you’ll realize so much of the results come during the “ boring “ 
Fueling my body with real food and loving how I look and feel will never be miserable. 

It’s ok if you want to lose weight. In a society where that’s been deemed “toxic” 
I actually think me living in a body I wasn’t confident in and didn’t take care of was much more toxic. No one should make you feel like shit for wanting to improve yourself.",0,"08/12/2025 06:33",https://www.instagram.com/p/DNQbxhPgAPL/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,93107,33847,2078,46,4,798,138
